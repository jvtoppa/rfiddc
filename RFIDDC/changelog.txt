10/07/2023 - RFIDDC ver.1.10

- Changed theme to LightGrey5.
- Created stats() function. It does nothing at the moment and only serves as template for future modifications to the code.
- Created readme() function, which allows the user to read the changelog, the README and the credits directly from the client.
- Removed old "Register/Hour" filter because it was obsolete.
- The "Select all" button for the new "Register/Hour" filter now works properly.
- Created a proper README.
